            <div class="subheading">It started as a bicycle. It ended as a full-on motorcycle.</div>
            <div class="node">
                This page showcases the first build process from bicycle to motorcycle. For the latest build, see the <a href="https://trenavix.com/emoto/2.0/">2.0 build page!</a><br><br>
                The development of my first electric motorcycle was an ongoing upgrade process throughout years.
                At this point I know how to build electrical motorcycles from the ground up.<br><br><hr>
                When first moving to Los Angeles, I got a cheap bicycle just to get around the area.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="bicycle.jpg"><br>
                The hills took a toll on me, so I ended up slapping a hub motor on it, and 52v battery on a rear rack.<br>
                Little did I realise, a 52v30ah battery was <i>much more</i> energy than I needed. I was flying around at 55-65kmph!<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="ebike_PV.jpg"><br>
                Taking the battery into work with me every day was a pain, and the rear rack cracked from the weight of the battery.<br>
                At this point I figured a steel frame to secure the battery was a wise investment.<br>
                However, the steel frame needed a rear shock absorber. This was my first ever rear suspension in a bike!<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="goofy_ebike.jpg"><br>
                I was definitely aware that the old front fork was more than subpar suspension compared to the rear at this point.<br>
                So naturally, I pitched in for some better front suspension (DNM-USD 8)<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="new_fork.jpg"><br>
                I also felt like the bicycle seat looked a bit goofy with the rest of the build, so I got a pitbike seat.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="new_pitbike_seat.jpg"><br>
                With this style, I could now wear a dualsport moto helmet without it looking out of place, which kept that 60kmph wind out of my eyes.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="new_helmet.jpg"><br>
                After some off-roading, some spokes broke on that rear wheel, the motor could bake an egg, and the tire wore out very quickly.<br>
                At this point I opted for a motorcycle rim/tire (1.85x19in rim, SR241 2.75-19 tire) with a 3kW 72v motor.<br>
                This was also the point at which <u>I removed the pedals,</u> thereby making it a <u>motorcycle/scooter.</u>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="3kW_Motor.jpg"><br>
                Problem was, the motor's kV rating was awfully low, and as such, the top speed really suffered.<br>
                It would top out at about 1kW on flat with a 45kmph speed at 52v. Yikes.<br>
                A quick fix to me was: increase the voltage. And as such I did, with a 72v30Ah battery.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="72vBattery.jpg"><br>
                With the voltage bump, it was able to top out at about 1.8kW with a 65kmph speed on flat. Still not great, but better.<br>
                The torque uphill/offroading was great, though, with 4kW continuous power.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="offroading2.jpg"><br>
                With how much riding I did on the street, I knew I needed a brakelight and signals, so my first step was an LED strip in the rear with brakelight and signal wires.<br>
                This required a small 12v downstep module from 72v, spliced from a disconnect of my battery wires. I opted for some $10 one on amazon capable of 10A.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="brakelight.jpg"><br>
                Thereafter, I got signals in the front, and a 5.75in motorcycle headlight.<br>
                This made riding around at night much easier, without needing to charge small bicycle lights that were much weaker.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="headlight.jpg"><br>
                I then found a J1772 to IEC C13 adapter online, which allowed me to charge my bike at almost all EV chargers in California.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="EV_Charger.jpg"><br>
                At this point, the <i>only</i> thing making this build <i>not</i> look like a motorcycle was the front bicycle wheel.<br>
                <b>So...</b> <i>Naturally,</i> I got a matching motorcycle rim for the front, laced onto a dual-rotor 20mm thru axle hub.<br>
                However, this time, I went for a road tire. A Michelin Pilot Activ 3.25-19in tire.<br>
                This made turning much safer and smoother, whereas the thin bicycle tire before felt like riding on a tightrope in comparison, especially with the bike weight.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="new_front_wheel.jpg"><br>
                It was at this point I found a longer motorcycle seat, making it easier to have a passenger behind me, as well as being more comfortable.<br>
                I found a new matching rear fender, and also found a motorcycle hitch for my car, in which I modified the framing to support.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="moto_hitch.jpg"><br>
                At this point, I had replaced almost <i>every single part</i> I started with, and was able to <b>rebuild the old bicycle</b>!
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="both_bikes.jpg"><br>
                The top speed of the motor was very annoying to me, in the way it would not even get close to max power for speed usage.<br>
                I ended up paying a lump sum for a QS-273 v3 50H motor laced into a 1.85-19in rim, <i>however</i>, I was completely unaware that the axle flats were 2mm larger than standard.<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="qs-273.jpg"><br>
                This motor went unused for nearly a year as filing steel drop-outs was a task I seemed to put off forever. However, a year later...<br>
                <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="finalbuild.jpg"><br>
                I had used tungsten dremmel bits to carve the dropouts, followed by filing bits, followed by steel files to get it down to a tenth of a millimetre accuracy.<br>
                I tapped in my own bolt hole threading for a torque washer in the side of the swing-arm for further protection.<br>
                I drilled mounting holes in the frame for a new DC-AC three-phase controller, the Kelly KLS7230s, which was pushing around 6kW of power and up to <b>300 phase amps.</b><br>
                The bike was now capable of <u>100kmph on flat</u> with acceleration showing 0-65kmph in about 2-3 seconds.<br>
                The range was anywhere from 65-110km, depending on speed/power usage, and it could be charged at any EV charger.<br>
                This bike was stolen in December 2020, but has now been <u>recovered</u> in May 2021 from Riverside!<br><br>
                Update Jan 2022: I rebuilt new batteries for the bike myself: 3 in parallel, altogether 72v50AH. The bike's total power is risen to 8kW Continuous and range boosted significantly.
